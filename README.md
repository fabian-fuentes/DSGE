# DSGE Modeling Examples

This repository contains several Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) examples built using the [`gEcon`](https://gecon.r-forge.r-project.org/) package for R.  Each model folder includes R scripts (`*.r`), model definition files (`*.gcn`) and auto-generated code from gEcon (`*.model.R`).  Resulting data from running the scripts are stored as CSV files in each directory.

```
HabitFormation/        Habit formation model from Torres (2015)
NonRicardianAgents/    Non-Ricardian agents and tax simulations
RealBusinessCycle/     Basic real business cycle (RBC) model
```

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0 or higher is recommended)
- R packages: `gEcon`, `nleqslv`, `Rcpp`, `reshape2`

The `gEcon` package is available from the R-Forge repository. Within an R session run:

```R
install.packages('nleqslv')
install.packages('Rcpp')
install.packages('reshape2')
install.packages("https://gecon.r-forge.r-project.org/files/gEcon_1.2.3.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Running the models

After installing the required packages, set your working directory to the repository root in R or RStudio and source the script of interest. Example for the RBC model:

```R
setwd("/path/to/DSGE")         # adjust path
source("RealBusinessCycle/rbc_script.r")
```

Scripts for the other models can be run in the same way:

```R
source("HabitFormation/hf_script.r")                     # Habit formation model
source("NonRicardianAgents/Taxes_chapter7_script.r")   # Tax and Laffer curve analysis
source("NonRicardianAgents/nRa_chapter4_script.r")     # Non-Ricardian agents model
```

Running a script generates output CSV files inside the corresponding folder (e.g. `RealBusinessCycle/out.csv`). These files contain impulse response simulations and related results that can be used for further analysis or visualization.
