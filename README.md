# DSGE Modeling Examples

This repository contains several Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) examples built using the [`gEcon`](https://gecon.r-forge.r-project.org/) package for R.  Each model folder includes R scripts (`*.r.r`), model definition files (`*.gcn`) and auto-generated code from gEcon (`*.model.R`).  Resulting data from running the scripts are stored as CSV files in each directory.

```
HabitFormation/        Habit formation model from Torres (2015)
NonRicardianAgents/    Non-Ricardian agents and tax simulations
RealBusinessCycle/     Basic real business cycle (RBC) model
```

## Requirements

- R (version 4.0 or higher is recommended)
- R packages: `gEcon`, `reshape2`

The `gEcon` package is available from the R-Forge repository. Within an R session run:

```R
install.packages("gEcon", repos = "https://R-Forge.R-project.org")
install.packages("reshape2")
```

## Running the models

After installing the required packages, set your working directory to the repository root in R or RStudio and source the script of interest. Example for the RBC model:

```R
setwd("/path/to/DSGE")         # adjust path
source("RealBusinessCycle/rbc_script.r.r")
```

Scripts for the other models can be run in the same way:

```R
source("HabitFormation/hf_script.r.r")          # Habit formation model
source("NonRicardianAgents/Taxes_chapter7_script.r.r")   # Tax and Laffer curve analysis
source("NonRicardianAgents/nRa_chapter4_script.r.r")    # Non-Ricardian agents model
```

Running a script generates output CSV files inside the corresponding folder (e.g. `RealBusinessCycle/out.csv`). These files contain impulse response simulations and related results that can be used for further analysis or visualization.

### Jupyter notebooks

Some directories contain `.ipynb` notebooks demonstrating the steps in a more interactive manner. You can open them with Jupyter after installing the [IRkernel](https://irkernel.github.io/) R kernel:

```R
install.packages("IRkernel")
IRkernel::installspec()
```

Launch Jupyter and open the notebook to reproduce the results step by step.
